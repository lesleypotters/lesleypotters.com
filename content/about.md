I have over 15 years of working experience. I have worked for the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission as an Economic Analyst, working on the impact of firm-level innovation. You can find some of my - more econometrical - work that has been published in scientific journals on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l7EatXkAAAAJ&hl=en). Furthermore I have been working in the private sector, mainly as a Pricing Analyst for a car insurance company.

I really enjoy doing sports, like football, [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/56698477), and some weight training. Sporadically, I update my blog with some insights from reading - mainly fiction but also non-fiction.  

Do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact/) if you have any questions or inquiries.
