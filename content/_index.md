Thanks for visiting my personal website. Ia am Lesley Potters, currently working as an independent data analyst in Spain. I use Machine Learning for a wide range of applications, such as forecasting, pricing, conversion rates and risk analysis. I invite you to have a look at my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/lesleypotters) repositories where some main concepts I work with are shown. If I have time, I also write on my [blog](/blog/) about data and other things I like.
