Below you will find various projects that I usually not finish... (shame on me)

<ul>
    <li>Ya Leo, an app to teach children how to read</li>
    <li>Reddit Formula 1 mentioning of drivers during the live race discussions throughout the 2021 season</li>
    <li>Text analysis of Johan Cruijff</li>
    <li>Creation of an app to find open and free working spaces nearby</li>
</ul>
